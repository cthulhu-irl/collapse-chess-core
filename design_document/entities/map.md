# State Class

**NOTE**: this is a class only to be extensible.

## Properties

Each property is described in format "\<name\> : \<type\>" under its access attribute.

*   public:
    *   status : Status

        > status of the board/game.

## Methods

Each method is described in simple C++ method prototype form.

**NOTE**: it's **simplified**! meaning type notations are not _exact_ but from same class. being *const* or *pointer* or etc. will be decided later.

*   constructor(s):
    *   Map()

        > creates an empty table of 8x8.

    *   Map(/\* 8x8 matrix of Piece \*/)

        > just sets the right argument to the corresponding property.

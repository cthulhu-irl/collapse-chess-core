    + point should range 0-7 rather than 1-8
      due to indexing headaches

    - either remove brace initializer constructor from Map (and IMap)
      or fix it to get array<pair<Type, PieceRole>, 8> instead

    - use simple if-else (inline) rather than binary techniques
      for step way detection

    - fix midway looper in Queen, Bishop and Rook

    - add virtual destructors to all interfaces and implementations
